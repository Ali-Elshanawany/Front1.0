### Authentication with `localStorage`

Unlike traditional backend authentication services, this project uses **localStorage** to handle user sessions and authentication. The authentication process involves storing the userâ€™s session data (like login credentials and user role) in the browser's local storage, which can persist even when the user refreshes the page or reopens the app.

### Steps to use authentication:

1. **Login**: When a user logs in, their role and status are stored in `localStorage` (e.g., `userRole: 'customer'` or `userRole: 'admin'`).
2. **Session Persistence**: User sessions persist even after page reload, allowing users to stay logged in until they log out or the session expires.
3. **Role-Based Access**: Based on the stored role in `localStorage`, the application shows different content and features for customers, sellers, or admins.
